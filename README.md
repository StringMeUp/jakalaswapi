This is an example app that tries to follow the "Guide to app architecture" recommendations: (MVVM) with Ui/Domain/Data layers, built with the help of https://swapi.dev.

The app was written in kotlin i.e. using Jetpack Compose and utilizes the following dependencies: (for more details check libs.versions.toml)
1. Hilt
2. Hilt Navigation Compose
3. Navigation Compose
4. Retrofit
5. Kotlinx Serialization
6. Kotlinx Serialization Converter
7. OkHttp
8. Lifecycle Compose

Unfortunately there was no time to implement offline functionality with Room. But that is definitely the way to go.
